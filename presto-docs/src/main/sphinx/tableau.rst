Presto Web Connector for Tableau
***************************************

Presto web connector for Tableau implements the functions in the Tableau
web connector API and lets users run queries from Tableau against Presto. You can get more info
about the Tableau web connector API at `<http://community.tableau.com/community/developers/web-data-connectors>`_.

When creating a new web data source Tableau will ask for the URL of the web connector, which is
``http://presto_master_host:8080/presto-connector.html`` where ``presto_master_host`` is the hostname that
Presto coordinator is running on. When Tableau first loads the Presto web connector it will render an HTML form.
In this form you need to fill in details such as your user name, the catalog and the schema you want to query,
the data source name, and finally the SQL query to run. After you click ``Submit`` the query will be submitted
to the Presto coordinator and Tableau will then create an extract out of the results retrieved from the coordinator page by page.
After Tableau is done extracting the results of your query you can then use this extract for further
analysis with Tableau.

.. note::
     With Presto web connector you can only create Tableau extracts as the web connector API
     currently doesn't support the live mode.
